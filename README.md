## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm FC8A26, which is also a hex color for a nice (in my opinion) shade of orange. I'm an amateur programmer - I mainly use python (though occasionally I use other languages). Readability counts, so I'm going to make the following text super big:

<span style="font-size:5em;">REFUSE THE TEMPTATION TO GUESS</span>
